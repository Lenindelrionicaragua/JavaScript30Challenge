      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);
      age = 200; // Both variables contain the same initial value, but they are independent copies. Modifying 'age' won't affect 'age2' since they are separate copies.
      console.log(age, age2);

      let name = "Len";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = "Del Rio"; // Both variables contain the same initial value, but they are independent copies. Modifying 'age' won't affect 'age2' since they are separate copies.

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      const team = players;

      console.log(players, team);
      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      team[3] = "lux"; // Modifying 'team' also affects 'players' as they both reference the same array.

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      const team2 = players.slice(); // Create a copy of the 'players' array using the slice method without specifying any arguments.

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const team3 = [].concat(players); // Create a copy of the 'players' array by concatenating it with an empty array.

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team4 = [...players]; // Create a copy of the 'players' array using the spread operator to spread its elements into a new array.
      const team5 = Array.from(players); // Create a new array from 'players', leaving the original array untouched.

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99; // Since 'captain' is a reference, we are changing the original object 'person'.

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 }); // Create a new object 'cap2' by merging the properties of 'person' with a new property 'number' set to 99.
      console.log(cap2); // Output the newly created object 'cap2'.

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // const cap3 = { ...person };

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const len = {
        name: "Len",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@lendelrio",
          facebook: "Lendelrio.developer",
        },
      };

      console.log(len);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, len); // Create a shallow copy of 'len', so the 'social' property still points to the original object.
      dev.name = "Dan";

      console.log(dev);
